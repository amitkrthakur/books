Node environemnt required to start the dev server and Angular need to be installed globally to be able to run `ng serve` command. `npm start` command could also be used to do the same.

## Build

Run `ng build` or `npm run build` command to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Deployment

For static deployment use the artifacts generated after successfully running the build process. Copy all contents from the `dist/<project-name>` and place it in the server root directory from where the application needs to be served.

#### NOTE

Configure the server to send all requests to the index file
